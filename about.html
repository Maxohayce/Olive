	  <p class="lead">There are historic challenges confronting today’s healthcare industry. An unprecedented shift from payment models based on volume to those centered on outcomes has deeply affected every sector of the healthcare industry across every region of the world. The impact of this transformation combined with aging populations, soaring costs, stunning advancements in data, analytic, and medical technology, growing consolidation among payers and providers, increasing coordination of care, deepening public-private partnerships, and global healthcare reform efforts is fracturing foundational assumptions, mindsets, and strategies throughout the industry. These disruptions pose complex threats but they also present valuable opportunities for organizations that are able to pinpoint where they can redefine their value and deliver the greatest impact. The success of these strategies pivots on execution and 90 percent of execution hinges on having the right organizational structures and talent management in place.<br><br>
