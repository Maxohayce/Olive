            <p> Advancements in today’s healthcare technology promise transformative improvements in quality and value of care. Providers are rapidly developing groundbreaking solutions related to software, analytics, digital, mobile, telehealth, and health and wellness. In addition, they are providing critical service improvements in revenue cycle optimization and other IT offerings. These new and emerging solutions are creating major challenges and opportunities within hospitals, health systems, academic medical centers, payers and other healthcare-related companies. And they create unprecedented demand for leaders, staffs and organizational structures that understand the best ways to leverage these advancements to allow organizations to survive and thrive in these exciting times.<br><br>
			OLIVE HEALTH FOUNDATION was birthed by a concerted effort from a team of blockchain developers and software programmers seeking a solution to a major medical problem— the inability to effectively locate various health tech development companies, whom have  groundbreaking innovations that could go along way in providing hospitals with innovative technology that could help the combat and control of many diseases, also matching donors for ailing patients suffering that require transplats such as kidney related diseases and other terminal illnesses, and quickly enough to reduce mortality rates.</p>

Large pharmaceutical firms are usually less risky to invest in, as compared with their younger or smaller counterparts. These companies spend a major portion of their resources on R&D (Research & Development), to bring innovative treatments to the market.</p>

Therefore, when their stock is available for investment in, they do tend to offer good investment potential. Here, too, the larger companies would offer more stable potential and lesser risk. Of course, risk is always a part of any investment, and good risk management strategies is vital.</p>

The products offered by them range from bandages to artificial joints, and from digital blood pressure monitors to heart stents, and much more. Such devices will always be in demand, but an instant boom of any specific device is unlikely.</p>

	    Investment Strategy
	  </div>
	  <div class="card-body">
	    <p class="card-text">In January 2019, Frost & Sullivan predicted that the global healthcare market is likely to grow by 5.1% in 2019 and would cross the $1.96 trillion mark in manufacturer revenues by the end of the year.
		Frost & Sullivan, in their yearly transformational health report, stated that this growth is expected to be driven by advancements in technology platform solutions that lead to innovation in healthcare and chronic disease management, as well as through the emerging markets.<br><br>
		In fact, Deloitte's 2019 Global Health Care Outlook report reveals that global healthcare spend is likely to increase at an annual rate of 5.4% between 2017-2022, from USD $7.724 trillion to USD $10.059 trillion.
		All of these statistics certainly make investing in healthcare stocks seem like a good idea. Add to that the fact that Charles Schwab gave an 'Outperform' rating to this sector on September 27, 2018, and medical stocks seem to become even more attractive.<br><br>
		In fact, healthcare stocks rank third after the technology and finance sector in the S&P 500 index. However, even for a sector that appears extremely appealing, it's important to make informed investment decisions using the right analytical tools, and remain updated with the latest news and economic announcements within the sector. And this really is a large sector that goes far beyond hospitals and pharma companies. 
		Here's a look at the various types of companies Olive chooses from when searching for the best healthcare dividend stocks</p>
